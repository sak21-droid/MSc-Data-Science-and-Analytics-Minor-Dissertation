The following repository contains code for all analyses of the three wave clips used for the project. Python was used for all visualizations and analysis of large-scale wave clips(Wave Clip 1 and Wave Clip 2), while R was used for full PCA and reconstruction of the small-scale wave dataset. The code uses the methodology outlined in the project and creates plots seen throughout the project.
All datasets and reconstructed results can be accessed by clicking the link below :
